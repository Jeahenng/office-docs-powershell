# Remove-RetentionComplianceRule

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in Security & Compliance PowerShell. For more information, see [Security & Compliance PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/scc-powershell).

Use the Remove-RetentionComplianceRule cmdlet to remove retention rules from the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-RetentionComplianceRule [-Identity] <PolicyIdParameter>
 [-Confirm]
 [-ForceDeletion]
 [-PriorityCleanup]
 [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Removing a retention rule causes the release of all Exchange mailbox and SharePoint site retentions that are associated with the rule. Removing a retention rule also causes the corresponding retention policy to become invalid, so you should remove it by using the Remove-RetentionCompliancePolicy cmdlet.

To use this cmdlet in Security & Compliance PowerShell, you need to be assigned permissions. For more information, see [Permissions in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/microsoft-365-compliance-center-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Remove-RetentionComplianceRule -Identity "One Year Standard"
```

This example removes the retention rule named "One Year Standard".

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the retention rule to remove. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the rule. For example:

- Name
- Distinguished name (DN)
- GUID

```yaml
Type: PolicyIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Security & Compliance

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Security & Compliance

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ForceDeletion
The ForceDeletion switch forces the removal of the rule. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Security & Compliance

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PriorityCleanup
The PriorityCleanup switch specifies whether to remove the rule associated with a Priority cleanup policy. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

Priority cleanup policies expedite the deletion of sensitive content by overriding any existing retention settings or eDiscovery holds. For more information, see [Priority Cleanup](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/priority-cleanup).

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Security & Compliance

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
The WhatIf switch doesn't work in Security & Compliance PowerShell.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi
Applicable: Security & Compliance

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
